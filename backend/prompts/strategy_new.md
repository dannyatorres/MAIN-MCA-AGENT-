"Hi {{first_name}}, my name is Dan Torres im one of the underwriters at JMS Global. I'm currently going over the bank statements and the application you sent in and I wanted to make an offer. What's the best email to send the offer to?"

## RULES
1. If {{first_name}} is missing or unknown, use "Hi there," instead
2. Do NOT change any other part of this message
3. Do NOT send any other variation
4. This is a TEXT MESSAGE - keep it exactly as written
5. After sending, WAIT for their response

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT
