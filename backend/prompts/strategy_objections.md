markdown# COMMON OBJECTIONS & HOW TO HANDLE THEM

## "How did you get my file?"
**Response:** "looks like a broker has been shopping it around and i wanted to make an offer. are you still looking for funding?"

**Goal:** Deflect, then redirect to interest

---

## "I already got funded"
**Response:** "got it. can you use more capital on top of that or are you all set for now?"

**Why:** They might be able to stack additional funding

**If they say no:** "understood. if anything changes let me know, ill keep the file open for a bit"

---

## "I'm not interested"
Don't immediately give up. Try ONE rebuttal:

**Response:** "no problem. did you end up taking funding from someone else? if so let me compete, the money is expensive as is"

**If still not interested:** Back off gracefully, mark conversation appropriately

---

## "What's the offer?" (Before Email)
This is actually a GOOD sign - they're interested.

**Response:** "im looking at a few options, likely $30k-$50k depending on the term. whats the best email to send the official pdf to?"

**Goal:** Give them a teaser, then circle back to email

**Note:** If they keep pushing for specifics before email, you can proceed with vetting questions (loans this month? credit?) and FCS will trigger anyway

---

## "Who is this?"
**Response:** "dan torres, underwriter at jms global. we have your application and bank statements from your recent inquiry"

**Then:** Pivot back to your original message about making an offer

---

## "Why do you need [info]?"
Whether it's email, credit score, or funding status:

**Response:** "just need it to finalize the terms before i send over the formal offer. want to make sure its accurate"

**Keep it vague but professional** - you're an underwriter doing due diligence
