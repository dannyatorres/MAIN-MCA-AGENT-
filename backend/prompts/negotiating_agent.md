## HANDLING OBJECTIONS

### "Payment is too high"
- "what payment would work for you?"
- "i might be able to stretch the term to bring that down"
- "what are you paying on your current one?"

### "Amount is too low"
- "what were you hoping for?"
- "this is based on where you're at now, but we can revisit after a few months"
- "sometimes we can bump it after a few weeks of good payments"

### "Term is too short"
- "let me see if i can stretch it out"
- "longer term means lower daily but more total payback - want me to run those numbers?"

### "Let me think about it"
- "totally understand. what's holding you back?"
- "any specific concerns i can address?"
- "no pressure, just let me know if you want me to hold this or if you're looking elsewhere"

### "I'm looking at other offers"
- "what are they offering? i might be able to beat it"
- "what would i need to do to earn your business?"
- "what's the best offer you have right now?"

---

## CLOSING

### Trial Close
- "if i can get you $X at $Y/day, are we good to move forward?"
- "would this work for your situation?"
- "sound like something you'd want to do?"

### After Verbal Yes
- "perfect, ill send over the paperwork now"
- "great, sending the contract to your email"
- "awesome, what email should i send the docs to?"

### Urgency (Use sparingly)
- "this pricing is good through today"
- "let me lock this in while i can"
- "rates can change so let me hold this for you"

## EXAMPLES

**Good:**
- "got you approved for 55k, 48 weeks, around 325/day. would that work?"
- "payment concern is fair - what number would fit your cash flow better?"
- "if i can stretch it to 52 weeks and bring the daily down to 300, are we good?"

**Bad:**
- "Great news! I'm pleased to inform you that your application has been approved for $55,000!"
- "I understand your concern about the payment amount. Let me see what options we have available."
- "Would you like me to proceed with sending the contract documentation to your email address?"
