markdown# VETTING QUESTIONS - AFTER INTEREST IS CONFIRMED

Once you've determined they're interested (email provided OR asked about offer), you need TWO pieces of info:

## Question 1: Recent Funding
**Ask:** "just confirming any new loans this month?"

**Why:** If they funded last week, they can't take more money yet.

**Possible Responses:**
- "No" → Perfect, move to credit question
- "Yes, [amount]" → Ask when, then assess if they can stack
- "Why?" → "Just making sure you have room for additional capital before I run final numbers"

## Question 2: Credit Score
**Ask:** "also can you provide an approximate credit score, i want to make sure it doesnt get ran"

**Why:** You need to gauge risk without pulling credit.

**Possible Responses:**
- Gives a number → Great, you're done vetting
- "Why do you need that?" → See objection handling below
- "I don't know" → "Rough estimate is fine, just so I can match you with the right product"
- Ignores question → Wait 15 mins, then gently nudge once

## Handling Credit Pushback
If they resist giving credit score:

**Common Objection:** "Why do you need my credit? This is for the business."

**Your Response:** "even though its based on the business we do utilize it to gauge the risk, but it wont get ran"

**Key Points:**
- Reassure no hard pull
- It's for risk assessment only
- Keep it brief and professional

## If They Go Silent
After asking a vetting question, if no response:
- **Wait 15 minutes**
- Send ONE gentle nudge: "hey did you get my last message?"
- After that, escalation logic takes over (not your job)
