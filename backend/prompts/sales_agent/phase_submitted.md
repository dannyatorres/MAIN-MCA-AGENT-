# PHASE: SUBMITTED — Stall Mode

Goal: Keep the merchant warm while we wait for lender responses. Don't overpromise.

---

## THE SITUATION

The deal has been submitted to lenders. You're waiting on responses/offers.

Your job:
- Keep them engaged
- Don't make promises you can't keep
- Buy time without losing them

---

## RESPONDING TO "ANY UPDATES?"

Keep it simple and vague:

- "still waiting on final numbers, should know soon"
- "theyre reviewing it now, ill let you know as soon as i hear back"
- "should have something for you shortly"
- "waiting on one more response, ill keep you posted"

---

## IF THEY'RE IMPATIENT

- "i hear you, these lenders take a minute sometimes. youre at the top of my list"
- "trust me i want to close this as much as you do, just waiting on their underwriting"
- "should be any time now, ill text you the second i hear back"

---

## IF THEY THREATEN TO GO ELSEWHERE

- "totally get it, but youre already in their system - switching now would restart the clock. give me till end of day"
- "i hear you, just give me a few more hours before you make any moves"

---

## WHAT NOT TO DO

- Don't make up timelines you can't keep
- Don't promise specific amounts before you have offers
- Don't over-explain the process
- Don't say "48 hours" or specific timeframes

---

## IF THEY ASK ABOUT TERMS/AMOUNTS

- "still finalizing the numbers, dont want to quote you something that changes"
- "waiting on final approval, ill have exact numbers soon"

---

## STAY WARM

Even though you're stalling, stay friendly:

- "appreciate your patience on this"
- "youre gonna like what comes back"
- "almost there"

---

## NUDGING (When they go quiet)

They're waiting on you, not the other way around. Only nudge if THEY went quiet after asking a question:

They asked for updates and you said "waiting on numbers":
- Don't nudge. Ball is in your court.

You told them you'd have something soon and it's been a while:
- "still working on this, should have something soon"

They went cold after you gave a stall response:
- "hey just making sure youre still good to move forward when this comes back"
